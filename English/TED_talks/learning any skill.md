####     20个小时足够你学会任何技能

Hi everyone. One of the things that I enjoy is learning new things. How long does it take to acquire a new skill? You know what I found? 10,000 hours?! Nooooooo! I am never going to be able to learn anything new ever again. 

大家好啊。我喜欢的一件事就是学习新事物。掌握一项新技能需要多长时间？你知道我发现了什么吗？一万小时？！不！我再也学不到新的东西了。





But that's not true. The 10,000 hour rule rule came out of studies of expert level performance. Professional athletes, world class musicians. The folks at the tippy top of their fields put in around 10,000 hours of practice. 

但事实并非如此。10000小时规则来自对专家水平表现的研究。职业运动员，世界级音乐家。在他们领域顶端的人们投入了大约一万个小时的练习。







But that last statement it takes 10,000 hours to learn something? It's not true. This is the learning curve, and the story of the learning curve is when you start you're grossly incompetent and you know it. 

但最后那句话是不是需要一万个小时才能学到一些东西？这是不真实的。这就是学习曲线，而学习曲线的故事就是当你开始的时候，你是非常无能的，你知道这一点。





With a little bit of practice, you get really good really quick, and then at a certain point you reach a plateau an the subsequent gains become much harder to get. 

只要稍加练习，你就会很快变得非常出色，然后在某一点上达到平台期，随后的收获就会变得更加难以获得。







How long does it take from starting something and being grossly incompetent and knowing it to being reasonably good? Here's what my research says: 20 hours, that's it.

从开始做一件事，到完全不称职，并知道这一点，到做得相当不错，需要多长时间？我的研究是这样说的：20个小时，仅此而已。







 You can go from knowing nothing if you put 20 hours of focused deliberate practice into that thing, you will be astounded at how good you are. 20 hours is do-able, it's about 45 minutes a day for about a month. There's a method to doing this. 

如果你全神贯注地练习20个小时，你就会从一无所知，你会惊讶于自己有多棒。20个小时是可行的，每天大约45分钟，持续大约一个月。有一种方法可以做到这一点。







The first is to ==deconstruct the skill==, decide exactly what you want to be able to do and break it down into smaller and smaller pieces. The more you're able to decide what are the parts of this skill that will actually help me get to what I want. You'll be able to improve your performance  in the least amount of time possible. 

第一个是解构技能，准确地决定你想要做什么，并把它分解成越来越小的碎片。你就越能决定这项技能的哪些部分能真正帮助我得到我想要的东西。你将能够在尽可能少的时间内提高你的表现。







The second is ==learn enough to self-correct==. Get 3 to 5 resources about what it is you're trying to learn, it could be books, could be courses, could be anything. What you want to do is learn just enough that you can actually practice and self-correct. Noticing when you're making a mistake and then doing something a little different. 

第二个是==学会自我纠正==。获取3到5个关于你想学什么的资源，可以是书本，可以是课程，也可以是任何东西。你想做的就是学到足够多的东西，以便你能真正练习和自我纠正。注意到你什么时候犯了错，然后做了一些不同的事情。







The third is to ==remove barriers to practice==- distractions, distractions, television, Internet. 

第三个是消除练习的障碍--分心、分心、看电视、上网。







And the fourth is to practice for at least 20 hours. Now, most skills have what I call a frustration barrier. By committing to practicing whatever it is you want to do for at least 20 hours, you will be able to overcome that initial frustration barrier and stick with the practice long enough to actually reap the rewards. That's it, it's not rocket science. 

第四是练习至少20个小时。现在，大多数技能都有我所说的挫折障碍。无论你想做什么，只要坚持练习至少20个小时，你就能克服最初的挫折障碍，并坚持练习足够长的时间来真正收获回报。就是这样，这不是火箭科学。



   



The major barrier to learning something new is ==not intellectual. The major barrier is emotional==. Feeling stupid doesn't feel good and in the beginning of learning anything new...you feel really stupid. 

学习新东西的主要障碍不是智力。主要的障碍是情感上的。感觉愚蠢的感觉并不好，在开始学习任何新东西的时候……你会觉得自己真的很愚蠢。







But, put 20 hours into anything. Want to learn a language? Want to learn how to cook?  Want to learn how to draw? Go out and do that thing. It only takes 20 hours. Have fun.

但是，在任何事情上都要投入20个小时。想学一门语言吗？想学烹饪吗？想学画画吗？出去做那件事吧。只需要20个小时。玩得开心。
